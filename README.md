## Abstract

Stem-cell-based three-dimensional models of mammalian embryo development (stembryos) hold great promise in basic and applied research. However, considerable phenotypic variation despite identical culture conditions limits their potential. The biological processes underlying this seemingly stochastic variation are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the roots of this phenotypic variation by intersecting transcriptomic states (molecular fingerprints) and morphological history (phenotypic fingerprints) of individual stembryos across stages modeling post-implantation and early organogenesis. Through machine learning and integration of time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing with imaging-based quantitative phenotypic profiling of hundreds of structures, we identified early features predictive of the phenotypic end-state. We revealed that divergent metabolic states, associated with variable FGF and WNT signaling activity, underlie phenotypic variation. Importantly, chemical modulations of the metabolic profile tune the stembryo phenotype. Altogether, we provide a broadly applicable framework to chart and predict phenotypic variation in organoid systems, which can be leveraged to identify and control underlying biological processes.
